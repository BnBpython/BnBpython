# Welcome to BnB Github page!

## About Us
Founded in 2022, we strive to provide products and services for the needs within our power.  It is undeniable that the recent years of technological surging caused both general and specialized products to be overpriced.  Thus, it is all the more reason our organisation, BnB, is determined to cultivate easy, open-sourced products and services and become a precursor in the field.  Recently, one of our researches has won the International Science Project Compition(ISPC) prize.  In order to further achieve our goal, we are expanding our business beyond paperwork and delve into service/software/hardware.

## Projects

- **SRA**: A Discord bot aims to provide in-real-live(irl) chatting experience

<!-- - **Ganyu**: An APP to simulate all your anime-wives needs! -->
